# Gesture Recognizing Sensor

A compact and efficient gesture recognition system built using \[mention hardware, e.g., Arduino + APDS-9960 sensor]. It detects user hand gestures (up, down, left, right, near, far, etc.) and can be used in contactless control applications such as smart home automation, assistive tech, and more.

## üöÄ Features

* Recognizes multiple gestures: Up, Down, Left, Right, Near, and Far
* Real-time gesture detection with visual feedback
* Low-power, compact design suitable for embedded applications
* Easily integrable with Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms
* Can trigger actions (like toggling lights or switching modes) based on gestures
